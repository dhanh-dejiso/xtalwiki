### Hi there,

I am Hoang-Anh Dao, a crystallographer-wanna-be currently working at [SKK, Japan] as a researcher working on structure-based drug discovery.

This is an on-going doccument repository for archiving my knowledge and experience on Macromolecule Crystallography (especially those related to protein targets).
The contents are mostly adapted from a brief review article by [Alexander Wlodawer](https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/alexander-wlodawer) and his colleagues on the [FEBS Journal, 275(1), 2008](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.06178.x). 
My journey in crystallography (often we call it Xtal) started with this paper, so I hope that who are reading this could share parts of my nostalgic early career steps.

Right now the document are only available in English, I plan to have it translated into Japanese some time soon. 
I'm considering using a language switch button, but let me know if you have ideas for a better visuallization.


## Contents
### Here you can find the contents of this doc are organised as followed:
- Basic principles governing the diffraction phenomena using crystals (in general).
- Mutation, cloning vector preparation, PCR and expression of target protein in E. Coli cell.
- Growth and harvesting of bacteria cells, raw protein collection.
- Purification of collected protein samples using HPLC, Ni-NTA collumn (for His-tagged target) and tag cleavage.
- Protein crystallization and freezing.
- X-ray diffraction experiment @ synchrotron (raw data collection)
- Early raw data processing using XDS (determination of crystal quality, resolution, space group, ...) to create diffraction file.
- Methods for building structure model (brief explanations).
- Building models and structure refinement using either PHENIX or SHELX.
- Glossary and Dictionary/Terminology for terms and abbreviations for fast searches.

## Contact
I am trying to figure out a more iteractive way for people to send their feedbacks and questions on-site.

It may take some time so at the moment please email me via h_dao at skk-net.com.
